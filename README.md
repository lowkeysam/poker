## Game Concepts

### CSI (Chip Stacks Index)
```
CSI = Total Chips Ã· (Small Blind + Big Blind + Antes)
```
- **CSI > 10**: Play tight, avoid marginal spots
- **CSI 6-10**: Mixed strategy, position dependent
- **CSI < 6**: Push/fold mode, maximize fold equity

### Push/Fold Strategy
The application implements optimal push/fold ranges based on:
- Stack sizes (CSI calculations)
- Position at the table
- Number of players remaining
- Blind levels and antes

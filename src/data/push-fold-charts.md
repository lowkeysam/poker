## Special Situations

### With Antes (Multiply CSI by 1.2)
When antes are in play, all ranges can be widened by approximately 20% because the pot odds are better.

**Example**: If your calculated CSI is 5, treat it as CSI 6 for range selection.

### Against Tight Players
- Can push 15-20% wider
- They fold too often to aggression
- Especially effective from late position

### Against Loose Players  
- Tighten pushing ranges by 10-15%
- They call too light
- Need stronger hands to show profit

### ICM Considerations
Near bubble or big pay jumps:
- **Tighten calling ranges** by 20-25%
- **Can push slightly wider** to exploit tight players
- **Medium stacks most affected** by ICM pressure

---

## Nash Equilibrium Solutions

### Perfect Play Assumptions
These charts assume:
1. Opponents play optimally
2. No reads on opponents
3. No ICM considerations  
4. Standard tournament structure

### Real-World Adjustments
- Most players call too tight → Push wider
- Tight table → Steal more aggressively  
- Loose table → Tighten up slightly
- Bubble/Pay jump → Adjust for ICM

## Memory Tips

### Easy Ranges to Remember:

**CSI 0-2 Heads-Up**: Push any two from button, call top 40% from big blind

**CSI 5 Early Position**: "Lucky 7s and better" (77+, AT+, KQ)

**CSI 10 Button**: "4s and better, 7-high suited and better" (44+, A7s+, K7s+)

**Calling Rule**: Generally need about 20% stronger hands to call than opponent needs to push

Remember: **When in doubt, err on the side of aggression with short stacks!**

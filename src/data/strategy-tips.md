# Poker Strategy Tips & Guidelines

## Preflop Strategy

### Early Position (UTG, UTG+1, UTG+2)
- **Play tight from early position** - only premium hands
- Premium range: 88+, ATs+, AJo+, KQs, KQo
- **Avoid marginal hands** like suited connectors from EP
- **Consider CSI** when deciding between calling and pushing
- With short stacks (CSI < 10): Push range becomes 77+, A9s+, ATo+

### Middle Position (MP, MP+1)
- **Widen your range slightly** from middle position
- Can add: 77+, A9s+, ATo+, KJs+, KQo, QJs
- **Look for opportunities to isolate limpers**
- **Be aware of players yet to act** behind you
- Consider stack sizes of blinds before opening

### Late Position (CO, Button)
- **Take advantage of position** with wider opening ranges  
- **Consider stealing blinds** with marginal hands
- **Use position to play more speculative hands**
- Button is best position - can play 40-60% of hands when deep
- With short stacks: Push extremely wide from button

### Small Blind
- **Complete with wide range** when folded to you
- **Push very wide when short stacked** (CSI < 10)
- Against raises: defend with proper pot odds
- Heads up: push any two cards with CSI < 3

### Big Blind  
- **Get good pot odds to call raises**
- **Can call wider against late position raises**
- **Push over limpers when stack is short**
- Defend frequency depends on pot odds and opponent tendencies

## Post-Flop Strategy

### Flop Play
- **Continuation bet with strong hands and draws**
- C-bet frequency: ~65% in position, ~45% out of position
- **Consider pot odds when facing bets with draws**
- **Don't chase without proper odds**
- Board texture matters: wet boards require stronger hands

### Turn Play  
- **Turn bets are usually stronger than flop bets**
- Many players slow down on turn without strong hands
- **Recalculate your outs and odds** - only 1 card left
- **Consider implied odds for drawing hands**
- Be more selective with bluffs on turn

### River Play
- **Value bet thin when you likely have best hand**
- River is about maximizing value and minimizing losses
- **Don't bluff catch without strong reason**
- **Size your bets appropriately** for value or bluff
- Consider opponent's entire betting story

## Tournament Strategy

### General Tournament Guidelines
- **Adjust strategy based on bubble and pay jumps**
- **Use CSI to determine optimal strategy**
- **Be more aggressive when antes kick in** - better pot odds
- **Preserve chips for better spots** when deep stacked

### Early Tournament (Levels 1-5)
- Play tight and solid
- Build stack slowly
- Avoid marginal spots without good reason
- CSI typically 20-50+

### Middle Tournament (Levels 6-15)  
- Increase aggression as blinds grow
- Antes make stealing more profitable
- Start using push/fold more frequently
- CSI typically 8-25

### Late Tournament (Levels 16+)
- Push/fold becomes primary strategy
- ICM considerations become important
- Look for spots to accumulate chips
- CSI typically 3-15

### Bubble Play
- Many players tighten up near money
- Can steal more frequently from tight players  
- Be selective about big confrontations
- Medium stacks most affected by bubble pressure

## CSI-Specific Tips

### CSI 0-2 (Emergency Mode)
- **Push any two cards from small blind vs big blind**
- **Look for any reasonable spot to get chips in**
- **Don't fold in small blind unless facing a call**

### CSI 2-5 (Primary Push/Fold)
- **Push/fold is still primary strategy** 
- **Widen pushing ranges from late position**
- **Avoid calling raises without very strong hands**
- Use detailed push/fold charts for each position

### CSI 5-10 (Mixed Push/Fold)
- **Can occasionally call raises with strong hands**
- **Still primarily push/fold but with tighter ranges**
- **Look for spots to 3-bet shove**
- Position becomes more important

### CSI 10-15 (Limited Post-Flop)
- **Can start playing some post-flop poker**
- **Still avoid marginal spots without good odds**
- **Mix between pushing and raising**
- Use position more aggressively

### CSI 15+ (Standard Play)
- **Can play more standard poker**
- **Use position and post-flop skills**
- **Still be aware of CSI for key decisions**
- Look for accumulation opportunities

# CSI (Chip Stacks Index) Strategy Guide

## What is CSI?

**CSI = Total Chips √∑ (Small Blind + Big Blind + Antes)**

CSI is the fundamental metric that determines optimal tournament strategy. It tells you how many orbits you can survive before being blinded out.

## CSI Strategy Breakdown

### CSI 0-2: EMERGENCY MODE üö®
**Strategy: Push or Fold ONLY - No other actions**

#### Key Principles:
- Push any two cards from small blind vs big blind
- Push very wide from button in heads-up situations  
- Look for ANY spot to get chips in the middle
- Survival mode - need to double up immediately

#### Common Mistakes:
- ‚ùå Folding in small blind when should push any two
- ‚ùå Being too selective with hands
- ‚ùå Trying to play post-flop poker

#### Push Ranges:
- **Heads-up Button**: Any two cards (100% range)
- **Small Blind vs BB**: 22+, A2+, K2+, Q2+, J2+, T2+, 92+, 82+, 72+
- **3+ players**: Still very wide - 22+, A5+, K8+, Q9+, JT+

### CSI 2-7: PUSH/FOLD PRIMARY üìä
**Strategy: Primarily push/fold with specific hand ranges**

#### Key Principles:
- Use detailed push/fold charts for each position
- Slightly tighter ranges than CSI 0-2
- Can occasionally flat call with premium hands (AA, KK)
- Still avoid marginal post-flop situations

#### Position-Based Ranges:

**Early Position (UTG, UTG+1):**
- Push: 66+, ATs+, AJo+, KQs, KQo

**Middle Position:**  
- Push: 55+, A9s+, ATo+, KJs+, KQo, QJs, QJo

**Late Position (CO, BTN):**
- Push: 44+, A6s+, A8o+, K8s+, K9o+, Q8s+, Q9o+, J8s+, J9o+, T8s+, T9o, 98s, 87s

#### Calling Ranges vs Pushes:
- **Big Blind vs Button**: 77+, ATs+, AQo+, KQs
- **Big Blind vs CO**: 88+, AJs+, AKo, KQs  
- **Small Blind vs Button**: 99+, AQs+, AKo

### CSI 7-12: MIXED STRATEGY ‚öñÔ∏è
**Strategy: Push/fold and limited post-flop play**

#### Key Principles:
- Can start playing some post-flop poker

#### Post-Flop Guidelines:

## Positional Strategy

### Early Position (UTG, UTG+1, UTG+2)
- **Opening Ranges**: Premium hands only
- **CSI 0-7**: Push with 88+, ATs+, AJo+, KQs
- **CSI 7-12**: Can limp with small pairs occasionally
- **CSI 12+**: Standard tight opening ranges

### Middle Position (MP, MP+1) 
- **Opening Ranges**: Slightly wider - add KQ, AJ, smaller pairs
- **Key Considerations**: 
  - Players yet to act behind
  - Stack sizes of blinds
  - Recent table dynamics

### Late Position (CO, BTN)
- **Cutoff**: Second best position for steals and isolation
- **Button**: Best position - very wide ranges when short
  - CSI 0-5: Push extremely wide
  - CSI 5-10: Wide opening and stealing
  - CSI 10+: Can play many speculative hands

### Blinds
- **Small Blind**: 
  - Complete with wide range when folded to
  - Defend with proper odds against raises
  - Push very wide when short stacked
  
- **Big Blind**:
  - Get good pot odds to call raises  
  - Can call wider against late position raises
  - Push over limpers when stack is short

## Opponent Adjustments

### vs Tight Players
- ‚úÖ Push wider against them
- ‚úÖ Steal blinds more frequently  
- ‚úÖ They fold too often to aggression
- ‚ùå Call their pushes tighter

### vs Loose Players

- ‚úÖ Value bet thinner against them
- ‚ùå Avoid bluffing without strong equity
- ‚úÖ Can call their pushes wider

### vs Aggressive Players
- ‚úÖ Let them do the betting
- ‚úÖ Trap with strong hands
- ‚ùå Don't get into raising wars without premiums
- ‚úÖ Use their aggression against them

## Tournament Phases & CSI

### Early Levels (Deep Stacks)
- **Typical CSI**: 20-50+
- **Strategy**: Play tight, build stack slowly
- **Focus**: Avoid marginal spots, look for good doubling opportunities

### Middle Levels (Antes Start)
- **Typical CSI**: 10-25  
- **Strategy**: Increase aggression as blinds grow
- **Focus**: Antes make stealing profitable, start using CSI strategy more

### Bubble Phase
- **Typical CSI**: 5-15
- **Strategy**: Exploit tight play of others
- **Focus**: Many players tighten near money, can steal more frequently

### In the Money
- **Typical CSI**: 3-12
- **Strategy**: Adjust for pay jump pressure
- **Focus**: Players may tighten for next pay jump, short stacks become desperate

## Common CSI Mistakes

### Strategic Errors:
1. ‚ùå Not adjusting strategy based on CSI
2. ‚ùå Playing too many marginal hands from early position
3. ‚ùå Calling instead of pushing with short stacks
4. ‚ùå Not being aggressive enough on the bubble
5. ‚ùå Overvaluing hands out of position

### Mathematical Errors:
1. ‚ùå Not calculating CSI correctly 
2. ‚ùå Ignoring opponent stack sizes
3. ‚ùå Misusing push/fold charts
4. ‚ùå Not considering ICM implications
5. ‚ùå Failing to adjust for antes

### Psychological Errors:
1. ‚ùå Playing scared money poker
2. ‚ùå Not adjusting to opponent tendencies  
3. ‚ùå Overvaluing tournament life early

## Key Formulas & Calculations

### CSI Calculation:
```
CSI = Total Chips √∑ (Small Blind + Big Blind + Antes per hand)
```

### With Antes Example:
- Chips: 6,000
- Blinds: 100/200  
- Antes: 25 √ó 8 players = 200 total antes per hand
- CSI = 6,000 √∑ (100 + 200 + 200) = 12

### Stack Preservation:
- **CSI 20+**: Can afford to be patient
- **CSI 10-20**: Need to be more aggressive
- **CSI 5-10**: Push/fold primary strategy
- **CSI 0-5**: Emergency mode - any reasonable spot

## Quick Reference Chart

| CSI Range | Primary Strategy | Key Actions |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 0-2 | Push/Fold Only | Push any two from SB, very wide from BTN |
| 2-5 | Push/Fold Charts | Follow charts strictly, avoid post-flop |
| 5-10 | Mostly Push/Fold | Some calling with premiums, tight post-flop |
| 10-15 | Mixed Strategy | Limited post-flop, position important |
| 15+ | Standard Play | Full poker skills, still CSI aware |

Remember: **CSI determines strategy more than hand strength alone!**
